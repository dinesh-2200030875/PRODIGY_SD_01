Build a Temperature Conversion Program -->> Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

Explanation:

the source code consits of some methods/ functions they are -->> convertFromCelsius(float temp): Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin. convertFromFahrenheit(float temp): Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin. convertFromKelvin(float temp): Converts a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit. main(): Prompts the user to input a temperature value and its unit of measurement. It then calls the appropriate conversion function based on the input unit.
